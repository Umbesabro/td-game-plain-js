I created a simple tower defense game because I've always wanted to make a game. 
Although I watched some YouTube tutorials on various game development tools such as Unity and Godot, I didn't have the time to learn them. 
Instead, I used plain JS to create the game. While it's not fully complete, I believe it's ready enough to be shared with others.
